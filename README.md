## Audit Memorandum

MEMORANDUM
From: MBIN907_Bin Khairul Anuar, Muhammad Alif Afiq
To: ABC123_ABC, DEF
Subject: Investigation of Errors Identified in Trial Balance

This memorandum presents findings from the review of the trial balance, where two key discrepancies were identified. Each error, its potential impact on the accounting cycle, and the recommended corrective action are outlined below.

### 1. Overstatement in Revenue and Sales Accounts – $1,929.70
An amount of $1,929.70 was found to be overstated in both 201 – Electrical Sales and 824 – Revenue Received in Advance. Investigation through XERO’s search function revealed that this amount relates to an invoice issued to Ridgeway University.

Upon further review, it was discovered that the payment dated 20 February 2022 was not recorded, causing the system to treat the invoice as unpaid. This resulted in duplicated recognition of revenue and an overstated liability.

Corrective Action:
Navigate to the invoice via the search function, click ‘Add Payment’, and record the payment under the account ‘600 – Business Cheque Account’. Once the payment is recorded, the invoice will reflect a $0 balance, and both affected accounts will be updated accordingly.

Implications:
This error impacts the Revenue Cycle. Stock levels may decrease when goods are delivered, but revenue continues to be overstated. The overstatement of Revenue Received in Advance inflates liabilities and, indirectly, total assets, giving a false impression of financial strength. This misrepresentation could lead to poor operational decisions, such as over-borrowing due to an inflated asset-to-liability ratio.

### 2. Overstatement in Purchases – $2,476 Difference in Account 210
An excessive amount of $2,476 was found in 210 – Electrical Purchases. The discrepancy was traced to a bill from Drill Bits totaling $3,351. It appears that either the quantity or the unit price of the items was incorrectly recorded.

Corrective Action:
Open the bill using the search tool, click ‘Bill Options’ > ‘Edit’, and adjust the quantity or unit price according to the correct source document. Once corrected, the bill and associated account totals will be accurately reflected.

Implications:
This error affects the Expenditure Cycle. It falsely suggests that fewer inventory items were received, while the full payment was made. This could lead to unnecessary reordering, resulting in excess inventory and inefficient stock management.

### Conclusion
These errors highlight the importance of accurate transaction entry and reconciliation. Left uncorrected, such discrepancies can significantly distort the financial position of the business and lead to flawed strategic decisions. The recommended actions should be carried out promptly to restore integrity in the financial statements.
